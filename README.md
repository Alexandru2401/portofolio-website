# Portofolio-website
This is my portofolio-website. This project contains more information about me, a contact page, git repositories and live demo for every project that i made. 
It was written using HTML, Vanilla Css and React.
It's important to know that i work continuosly to improve myself, so this is not de final form. 
I will constantly update the website including my new projects.
Here you can see my portofolio-website : "https://my-portofolio-alex.netlify.app".

## Installation and Setup Instruction

### To run this project will need to follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository. You will ned node and npm installed globally on your machine.

2. Change directory: 
cd portofolio-project 

3. Install dependencies:
### `npm i`
To start the server:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Features 
Some features that will be implementing in the futured:
1. Add new projects that i made using other technologies such as tailwind Css, Sass, Stripe, etc.
2. Currently i study Python, so i want to make a new section that contains only projects written in python.
3. Make it responsive 100%. Right now, on different screen size, the images don't resize great and also the font-size is much bigger.
