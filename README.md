This is my portofolio-website. This project contains more information about me, a contact page, git repositories and live demo for every project that i made. 
It was written using HTML, Vanilla Css and React.
It's important to know that i work continuosly to improve myself, so this is not de final form. 
I will constantly update the website including my new projects.
