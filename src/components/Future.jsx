            Currently I am constantly working on projects and trying to use
            different technologies. I am learning data structures and algorithms
            in JavaScript to further develop my logic and thinking in
            programming.
          </p>
          <p className="hero-section-description">
            In the future I plan to start a university in IT. I also plan to
            learn the following technologies: TypeScript, Sass, Tailwind, Redux
            and Next.js. 
            <br />
            I also interact with the server side, in one of the
            courses i do on udemy, i have a section dedicated exclusively to the
            back-end, where i study technologies such as Express.js,
            Authentication and Security, EJS and Databases (noSql especially
            PostgreSQL). 
            <br />
            Development is continuous and when my motivation
            decrease, <span className="gold">perseverance</span> is what brings me <span className="gold">success</span>.
